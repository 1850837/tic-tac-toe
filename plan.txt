Opens with a menu:
    Play
    Leaderboard
    Close

Close: closes app

Leaderboard: prints leaderboard, which will be a table of the top 10 players (name, number of consecutive wins). Entries will be blank if they do not exist 
yet.

Play: asks for player 1 (x) and player 2 (o)'s names. (Under 16 chars) Prints the board (with coordinates) and asks player 1 to choose. The player should input
a coordinate. Prints the updated board. (If 3 or more turns have passed, check if a player has won). Asks player 2 for a choice. The player should input a 
coordinate. (If 3 or more turns have passed, check if a player has won). Repeat until a player has won. Consider all options (including a draw). A turn 
is counted when both players have put down a point.
After the game, it should prompt the following:
    Play again?
    Swap players?
    Exit?

Play again should simply do the same game again. Swap players should change which player is player 1 and which is player 2 (thus affecting turn order), WITHOUT
taking away the stored data of name and consecutive wins. Exit should save each player's name and consecutive win counter to the leaderboard (unless it's 0, which
it will for one of them), and then return them to the main menu.
